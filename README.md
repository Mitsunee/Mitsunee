# What I do
I make small online tools for games like Calculators or Event Timers. I mostly use JavaScript/TypeScript (still learning the latter) and a tiny bit of PHP. I also work as a freelancer for frontend development, though I am currently not looking for additional work.

## FGO Tools
I've been playing Fate/Grand Order since 2019 and have made various tools for the game since then.  
You can find a list of them [on the FGO Index site](https://www.mitsunee.com/fgo/) or through the [fgo-sites](https://github.com/Mitsunee/fgo-sites) Repository.  
The current versions are closed-source and written in jquery. A full rewrite turning the tools into a React app is currently in the works, which will be opensource when released.

## Pokemon Generation 3 Damage Calculator
To help with routing Speedruns of Pokemon Emerald I made a Damage Calculator based on C code written by pret (and team) based on a disassembly of the game. It is available at [mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc](https://www.mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc). The source code is available in the [Gen3DmgCalc](https://github.com/Mitsunee/Gen3DmgCalc) Repository.

## Libraries and such
I've written [Spork](https://github.com/Mitsunee/spork), a Javascript package for some small convenience functions such as `clamp()`, `range()` and classes to wrap `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.

I also have a [stuff](https://github.com/Mitsunee/stuff) repository where I post other random code snippets and scripts.
