# What I do
I am a JavaScript frontend developer (currently as a freelancer and hobbyist) and make tools and webapps related to games I play in my free time, as well as developing smaller libraries and contributing to libraries I use often. I've contributed fixes, features and translations to [spacetime](https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime), [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) and [other projects](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Amitsunee+-user%3Amitsunee+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+).

If you wanna know what I wanna learn/have learnt this year visit my [Coding Stuff (2021) Trello board](https://trello.com/b/w68tfAQP/coding-stuff-2021).

Wanna talk or even hire me? Feel free to visit my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZncPkjw) or @ me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mitsunee)!

# Projects

## FGO Tools
I've been playing Fate/Grand Order since 2019 and have made various tools for the game since then.  
You can find a list of them on the [FGO Index](https://www.mitsunee.com/fgo/) site.  
The current versions are closed-source and written in jquery/PHP; I am currently rewriting these sites as a NextJS app and redesigning them to work better on non-desktop screensizes, as well as of course adding a few new tools, in the [fgo-tools](https://github.com/Mitsunee/fgo-tools) Repository.

## Foxkit
[Foxkit](https://github.com/foxkit-js) is a javascript utility module collection dual-published as CJS and ESM with type declaration for TypeScript. The goal is to reduce the amount of code I constantly copypaste from project to project (like the `clamp` module) with centralized and fully tested known-good versions.

## Modern Diacritics
[modern-diacritics](https://github.com/Mitsunee/modern-diacritics) is a fork of the diacritics (formerly node-diacritics) and provides a modern solution to sanitize and normalize strings for search engine implementations. It is published as a tree-shakeable ES Module and provides several new features such as normalizing symbols like quotation marks and a slugify implementation using its sanitizer module.

## Pokemon Generation 3 Damage Calculator
In 2017 I made a Damage Calculator based on (at first a python script by G_Heinz and later) a disassembly of the Pokemon Ruby by pret (+team) to help with Speedrun routing. It is available at [mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc](https://www.mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc). The source code is available in the [Gen3DmgCalc](https://github.com/Mitsunee/Gen3DmgCalc) Repository.

## Atlas Academy
I've also contributed the initial versions (as well as some maintenance) of the ItemPage and ItemsPage components for Atlas Academy's [DB (FGO Game Data Navigator)](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/)

## Stuff
I also have a [stuff](https://github.com/Mitsunee/stuff) repository where I post other random code snippets and (user)scripts.
