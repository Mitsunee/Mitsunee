# What I do
I am a web developer (freelancer and hobbyist) making tools and webapps related to games I play in my free time. I also sometimes contribute to libraries I use often like [spacetime](https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime), [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) and [other projects](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Amitsunee+-user%3Amitsunee+-user%3Afoxkit-js+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+), as well as sometimes volunteering as a translator (English->German) for some projects. I have been working as a freelancer for frontend development (React/NextJS) since early 2021.

Wanna talk or even hire me? Feel free to visit my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZncPkjw) or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mitsunee).

## Goals for 2022

In 2022 I want to focus a little more on exploring Backend Tech as well as learning a non-web-related programming language for hobby projects as a change of pace. More detailed plans are on my [Trello board for 2022](https://trello.com/b/Btyu4S9s/coding-stuff-2022).

# My Projects

## FGO Timers

I've been playing Fate/Grand Order since 2019. My fansite [fgo.mitsunee.com](https://fgo.mitsunee.com/) focuses on providing timers for ingame events as well as information on future content (based on the japanese version, which is two years ahead).  
The code is fully open-source and available in the [fgo-tools](https://github.com/Mitsunee/fgo-tools) Repository. Some game data, as well as most of the game assets are provided by the [Atlas Academy Game Data API](https://api.atlasacademy.io/docs#/).

## JavaScript Packages

The [Foxkit](https://github.com/foxkit-js) project is a utility module collection dual-published as CJS and ESM with type declaration for TypeScript. The goal is to reduce the amount of code I constantly copypaste from project to project (like the `clamp` module) with centralized and fully tested known-good versions.

[modern-diacritics](https://github.com/Mitsunee/modern-diacritics) is a fork of the diacritics (formerly node-diacritics) with many new features providing a modern solution to latinizing strings and normalizing symbols for search engine implementations. It's dual-published and fully tested (just like Foxkit packages).

## Pokemon Generation 3 Damage Calculator

In 2017 I made a Damage Calculator based on (at first a python script by G_Heinz and later) a disassembly of the Pokemon Ruby by pret (+team) to help with Speedrun routing. It is available at [mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc](https://www.mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc). The source code is available in the [Gen3DmgCalc](https://github.com/Mitsunee/Gen3DmgCalc) Repository.

## Other Stuff

I also have a [stuff](https://github.com/Mitsunee/stuff) repository where I post other random code snippets in various coding languages and my personal collection of (user)scripts and bookmarklets. Most of them are licensed under WTFPL so feel free to play around with anything in that repo :)
