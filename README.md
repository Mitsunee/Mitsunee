# What I do
I am a JavaScript frontend developer (currently working as a freelancer) and make tools and webapps related to games I play in my free time. I am also currently starting to learn some backend-oriented technologies as well as Github Actions (and Gitlab CI).

If you wanna know what I wanna learn/have learnt this year visit my [Coding Stuff (2021) Trello board](https://trello.com/b/w68tfAQP/coding-stuff-2021).

# Projects

## FGO Tools
I've been playing Fate/Grand Order since 2019 and have made various tools for the game since then.  
You can find a list of them on the [FGO Index](https://www.mitsunee.com/fgo/) site.  
The current versions are closed-source and written in jquery/PHP. I am planning to fully rewrite these sites using modern technologies and redesign them to work better on non-desktop screensizes, as well as of course adding a few new tools.

## Pokemon Generation 3 Damage Calculator
In 2017 I made a Damage Calculator based on (at first a python script by G_Heinz and later) a disassembly of the Pokemon Ruby by pret (+team) to help with Speedrun routing. It is available at [mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc](https://www.mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc). The source code is available in the [Gen3DmgCalc](https://github.com/Mitsunee/Gen3DmgCalc) Repository.

## Atlas Academy
I've also contributed the initial versions (as well as some maintenance) of the ItemPage and ItemsPage components for Atlas Academy's [DB (FGO Game Data Navigator)](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/)

## Libraries and such
I've written [Spork](https://github.com/Mitsunee/spork), a Javascript package for some small convenience functions such as `clamp()`, `range()` and classes to wrap `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`. I am planning to re-release spork's modules as separate packages as well as add a few new ones in the future.

I also have a [stuff](https://github.com/Mitsunee/stuff) repository where I post other random code snippets and (user)scripts.
