# What I do
I am a web developer (freelancer and hobbyist) making tools and webapps related to games I play in my free time. I also sometimes contribute to libraries I use often like [spacetime](https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime), [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) and [other projects](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Amitsunee+-user%3Amitsunee+-user%3Afoxkit-js+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+), as well as sometimes volunteering as a translator (English->German) for some projects. I have been working as a freelancer for frontend development (React/NextJS) since early 2021.

# My Projects

## FGO Timers

I've been playing Fate/Grand Order since 2019. My fansite [fgo.mitsunee.com](https://fgo.mitsunee.com/) focuses on providing timers for ingame events as well as information on future content (based on the japanese version, which is two years ahead).  
The code is fully open-source and available in the [fgo-tools](https://github.com/Mitsunee/fgo-tools) Repository. Some game data, as well as most of the game assets are provided by the [Atlas Academy Game Data API](https://api.atlasacademy.io/docs#/).

## JavaScript Packages

The [Foxkit](https://github.com/Mitsunee/foxkit) project is a collection of npm packages with the goal of reducing the amount of code I constantly copy-paste from project to project (like the `clamp` module) with centralized and fully tested known-good versions and streamlining updates without breaking things by accident.

[modern-diacritics](https://github.com/Mitsunee/modern-diacritics) is a fork of the diacritics package with many new features providing a modern solution to latinizing strings and normalizing symbols.

[picoapi](https://github.com/Mitsunee/picoapi) is a WIP REST-client project that aims to create simple but powerful facades for requests with hooks and a Proxy-based API.

## Pokemon Generation 3 Damage Calculator

In 2017 I made a Damage Calculator based on (at first a python script by G_Heinz and later) a disassembly of the Pokemon Ruby by pret (+team) to help with Speedrun routing. It is available at [mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc](https://www.mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc). The source code is available in the [Gen3DmgCalc](https://github.com/Mitsunee/Gen3DmgCalc) Repository.

## Other Stuff

I also have a [stuff](https://github.com/Mitsunee/stuff) repository where I post other random code snippets in various coding languages and my personal collection of (user)scripts and bookmarklets. Most of them are licensed under WTFPL so feel free to play around with anything in that repo :)

## Future Goals

In 2022 I want to focus a little more on exploring Backend Tech as well as learning a non-web-related programming language for hobby projects as a change of pace. I also want to find more work (either freelance or a part-time position).

More detailed plans as well as a list of things I already learned or am currently learning are on my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Btyu4S9s/tech-coding).
