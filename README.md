# What I do
I make small online tools for games like Damage Calculators or Ingame Event Timers. I mostly use Javascript/jQuery and a tiny bit of PHP. I plan to learn more languages in the future and get into making Discord bots to accompany tools I've made like FGO Time.

## FGO Tools
I've been playing Fate/Grand Order and made an entire section of sites with tools for it.  
You can find them [on my site](https://www.mitsunee.com/fgo/) or through   
the [fgo-sites](https://github.com/Mitsunee/fgo-sites) Repository.

## Azur Lane Tools
Just like for FGO, I made a site with tools for Azur Lane. Currently there's only a timer site, but I'll probably add more in the future.  
You can find it [on my site](https://www.mitsunee.com/azurlane/#/). The repository will be made public in the future.

## Pokemon Generation 3 Damage Calculator
To help with routing Speedruns of Pokemon Emerald I made a Damage Calculator based on C code written by pret (and team) based on a disassembly of the game. It is available [here](https://www.mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc) and the [Gen3DmgCalc](https://github.com/Mitsunee/Gen3DmgCalc) Repository.

## Libraries and such
I've written a library to better manage Intervals and Timeouts in Javascript, which is available here: [fox-timers](https://github.com/Mitsunee/fox-timers).

I also have a [stuff](https://github.com/Mitsunee/stuff) repository where I post random code snippets that don't need a fullblown repo.
