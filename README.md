# What I do
I am a JavaScript frontend developer (currently as a freelancer and hobbyist) making tools and webapps related to games I play in my free time, as well as developing smaller libraries and contributing to libraries I use often like [spacetime](https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime), [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) and [other projects](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Amitsunee+-user%3Amitsunee+-user%3Afoxkit-js+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+). I've also volunteered as a translator (English->German) for some projects.

If you wanna know what I'm currently learning visit my [Coding Stuff](https://trello.com/b/w68tfAQP/coding-stuff-2021) Trello board.

# Projects

## FGO Timers
I've been playing Fate/Grand Order since 2019 and have made various tools for the game since then.  
You can find a list of them at [fgo.mitsunee.com](https://fgo.mitsunee.com/).  
The code is fully open-source and available in the [fgo-tools](https://github.com/Mitsunee/fgo-tools) Repository. Game data is provided by the [Atlas Academy Game Data API](https://api.atlasacademy.io/docs#/).

## JavaScript Packages
[Foxkit](https://github.com/foxkit-js) is a javascript utility module collection dual-published as CJS and ESM with type declaration for TypeScript. The goal is to reduce the amount of code I constantly copypaste from project to project (like the `clamp` module) with centralized and fully tested known-good versions.

[modern-diacritics](https://github.com/Mitsunee/modern-diacritics) is a fork of the diacritics (formerly node-diacritics) with many new features providing a modern solution to latinizing strings and normalizing symbols for search engine implementations. It's dual-published and fully tested (just like Foxkit packages).

## Pokemon Generation 3 Damage Calculator
In 2017 I made a Damage Calculator based on (at first a python script by G_Heinz and later) a disassembly of the Pokemon Ruby by pret (+team) to help with Speedrun routing. It is available at [mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc](https://www.mitsunee.com/gen3dmgcalc). The source code is available in the [Gen3DmgCalc](https://github.com/Mitsunee/Gen3DmgCalc) Repository.

## Atlas Academy
I've also contributed the initial versions (as well as some maintenance) of the ItemPage and ItemsPage components for Atlas Academy's [DB (FGO Game Data Navigator)](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/)

## Stuff
I also have a [stuff](https://github.com/Mitsunee/stuff) repository where I post other random code snippets and (user)scripts.
